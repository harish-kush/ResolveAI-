# 🎓 ResolveAI Interview Preparation & Learning Plan

Welcome to your structured interview preparation guide for **ResolveAI**! This guide is designed to transform you from a developer who *built* the codebase into an engineer who can *architect, defend, and explain* every design decision to a senior technical interviewer.

We have structured the learning journey into **6 core chapters**, progressing from high-level product design to granular code-level details and ending with real-world interview practice.

## 🗺️ The Learning Path

### 📂 Chapter 1: The Elevator Pitch & Project Overview
- **Objective:** Articulate the "What" and "Why" of ResolveAI in a way that hooks interviewers in the first 2 minutes.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - The business problem (traditional vs. AI support bottlenecks).
  - High-level System Architecture (MERN Stack + Redis + Socket.IO + Google Gemini).
  - Key technical highlights to mention immediately.

### 📂 Chapter 2: Data Modeling & Backend Architecture
- **Objective:** Explain the system's foundation—how data flows and where it lives.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Mongoose Schemas & Relationships (User, Org, Ticket, Conversation, Message, AITrainingData).
  - Why Redis? Caching strategies & speed optimization.
  - RESTful API design & middleware setup (Auth, Error handling).

### 📂 Chapter 3: The AI Engine (Gemini & Custom Training)
- **Objective:** Show off your AI integration skills—this is a huge selling point in modern interviews.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Gemini API Integration & Prompt Engineering.
  - Maintaining context & chat history (conversational memory).
  - The Web Crawler service: Scraping docs to build a dynamic Knowledge Base.

### 📂 Chapter 4: Real-time Communication (Socket.IO)
- **Objective:** Explain how real-time event-driven systems function under load.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Socket.IO server & client event flow (connection, room creation, messaging).
  - The Handoff: Seamlessly transitioning a user from AI assistant to a Human Agent.
  - Event synchronization & preventing message loss.

### 📂 Chapter 5: Smart Automations & Advanced Features
- **Objective:** Demonstrate engineering maturity through security, cron-like tasks, and analytics.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - 2-hour inactivity session expiry mechanism (data privacy & memory cleanup).
  - Ticket auto-escalation & Nodemailer agent notifications.
  - Real-time Analytics Dashboard using Recharts.

### 📂 Chapter 6: Deployment, Production Readiness & Mock Q&A
- **Objective:** Prepare for production-related questions and behavioral "gotchas."
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Production hosting (Render + Vercel + Upstash Redis).
  - "Tell me about a time you faced a difficult technical challenge" (e.g., Redis/Mongo connection issues, race conditions in socket updates).
  - Coding questions & design improvements you would make in version 2.0.

## 🚀 How We Will Proceed

1. **Step-by-Step Interactive Sessions:** We will cover one chapter at a time.
2. **Interactive QA:** At the end of each chapter, I will ask you a couple of real mock interview questions based on what we discussed. You can answer, and I will give you feedback to refine your response.
3. **Deep Code Dives:** We won't just talk theory; we will open the actual files in your workspace (like `server.js`, `aiService.js`, `socketHandler.js`) and look at the exact lines of code so you know exactly where everything is.
